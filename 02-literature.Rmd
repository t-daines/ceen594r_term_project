# Ramp Metering Design and Implementation

When freeway operations consistently deteriorate during peak hours, ramp meters are often implemented on the on-ramp, thus regulating the flow of vehicles entering the freeway. By controlling the flow of vehicles onto the freeway, motorists can travel in more favorable traffic conditions, which can reduce crashes, improve overall travel time, and lower emissions [@papageorgiou2002freeway]. Although conditions on the freeway may improve when ramp meters are implemented, this often leads to increased wait time on the on-ramp. Several ramp metering algorithms have been used in an attempt to find a balance between freeway and ramp operations, though much remains to be accomplished; many citizens contend that ramp meters cause more delay than they aim to prevent [@liu2007improving]. For example, Minnesota implemented ramp meters in 1969, and in the fall of 2000—at the request of citizens in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area—the meters were shut off for eight weeks to analyze whether freeway conditions were superior with the ramp meters [@levinson2004evaluating]. To the surprise of some traffic analysts, some areas of the Twin Cities showed decreased travel time without the ramp meters, though the results mostly showed that travel delay, average speed, and travel time performed significantly better with the ramp meters in use.  Other areas throughout both the United States and the world have shown similar results. In San Diego, a recently implemented ramp metering algorithm reduced travel time by more than four percent [@belisle2019evaluating]. The Seattle Bottleneck algorithm, used in many locations, has also reduced crash rates and average travel time [@jacobson2006ramp]. Thus, in order to best understand the benefits of ramp meters, it is imperative that their function be established.

There are two primary classifications of ramp meters: pre-timed meters and traffic-responsive meters [@jacobson2006ramp]. Pre-timed meters operate at a set rate based on historical data; this type of metering has proven effective when traffic volumes are easily predictable. However, when sudden changes in traffic operations occur, pre-timed meters often fail to account for the change without manual intervention. Traffic-responsive metering on the other hand relies on real-time data collection through the use of loop detectors, which can be placed within the pavement or in the form of traffic cameras. Due to the extensive amount of data being collected, the initial calibration of traffic-responsive meters can prove to be time consuming; however, once effectively implemented, they can mitigate congestion based on the data received on the ramp.
