[["index.html", "Estimation of Ramp Meter Queue Length Chapter 1 Abstract", " Estimation of Ramp Meter Queue Length Tanner Daines 2020-12-16 Chapter 1 Abstract Located on many on-ramps throughout Davis, Salt Lake, and Utah counties, ramp meters are used to regulate the flow of traffic during peak hours. On each ramp, there are detectors beneath the pavement located in three areas, including passage (after the ramp meter signal), intermediate (middle of the on-ramp), and excessive queue detectors (near the on-ramp entrance). These detectors provide data that include volume and occupancy counts, ramp meter rate, and the number of lanes on the ramp. UDOT is continuously collecting these data points to analyze ramp and freeway operations. Using these data, this project will seek to develop a reliable algorithm that can accurately reflect the vehicle queue length on a ramp. The focus of this project will be on the metered on-ramp at Layton Parkway in Davis County, with the aim for the algorithm to then be applied to additional ramps in Utah in the future. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction As traffic on freeways continues to rise, developing a reliable method to regulate the flow of vehicles onto the freeway has become increasingly important. A primary method that was first implemented in the 1960s is the ramp meter. A ramp meter is a traffic signal that is placed on the freeway on-ramp, designed to control the rate at which vehicles enter the freeway and therefore prevent it from exceeding capacity. Although ramp meters may improve freeway traffic conditions, they often generate a queue, causing vehicles to wait on the ramp prior to entering the freeway. The Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) has become concerned with this issue throughout the state. UDOT aims to have a method that accurately reports the expected queue length and wait time on any given on-ramp (that utilizes ramp metering) along I-15. This project will focus on estimating the queue length (# of vehicles) on one on-ramp; the ramp chosen for analysis is the northbound on-ramp to I-15 at Layton Parkway in Davis County, Utah. First, this report explains in brief detail the basic design and implementation of ramp meters in the form of a literature review. Next, the literature review will continue as the methods used for data analysis will be introduced. The data collection performed on the Layton Parkway on-ramp will then be discussed. Following that will be the interpretation and analysis of the data. Finally, the report will conclude with a summary of all items discussed. "],["literature.html", "Chapter 3 Literature 3.1 Ramp Metering Design and Implementation", " Chapter 3 Literature 3.1 Ramp Metering Design and Implementation When freeway operations consistently deteriorate during peak hours, ramp meters are often implemented on the on-ramp, thus regulating the flow of vehicles entering the freeway. By controlling the flow of vehicles onto the freeway, motorists can travel in more favorable traffic conditions, which can reduce crashes, improve overall travel time, and lower emissions (Papageorgiou and Kotsialos 2002). Although conditions on the freeway may improve when ramp meters are implemented, this often leads to increased wait time on the on-ramp. Several ramp metering algorithms have been used in an attempt to find a balance between freeway and ramp operations, though much remains to be accomplished; many citizens contend that ramp meters cause more delay than they aim to prevent (Liu and Michapoulos 2007). For example, Minnesota implemented ramp meters in 1969, and in the fall of 2000at the request of citizens in the Minneapolis-St. Paul areathe meters were shut off for eight weeks to analyze whether freeway conditions were superior with the ramp meters (Levinson and Zhang 2004). To the surprise of some traffic analysts, some areas of the Twin Cities showed decreased travel time without the ramp meters, though the results mostly showed that travel delay, average speed, and travel time performed significantly better with the ramp meters in use. Other areas throughout both the United States and the world have shown similar results. In San Diego, a recently implemented ramp metering algorithm reduced travel time by more than four percent (Belisle and Avr 2019). The Seattle Bottleneck algorithm, used in many locations, has also reduced crash rates and average travel time (Jacobson and Sallman 2006). Thus, in order to best understand the benefits of ramp meters, it is imperative that their function be established. There are two primary classifications of ramp meters: pre-timed meters and traffic-responsive meters (Jacobson and Sallman 2006). Pre-timed meters operate at a set rate based on historical data; this type of metering has proven effective when traffic volumes are easily predictable. However, when sudden changes in traffic operations occur, pre-timed meters often fail to account for the change without manual intervention. Traffic-responsive metering on the other hand relies on real-time data collection through the use of loop detectors, which can be placed within the pavement or in the form of traffic cameras. Due to the extensive amount of data being collected, the initial calibration of traffic-responsive meters can prove to be time consuming; however, once effectively implemented, they can mitigate congestion based on the data received on the ramp. References "],["methodology.html", "Chapter 4 Methodology 4.1 Methods to Estimate Ramp Queue Length", " Chapter 4 Methodology 4.1 Methods to Estimate Ramp Queue Length By using loop detectors on the ramps, time occupancy and traffic volume data are gathered. Occupancy refers to the percent of time a point on the road is occupied by a vehicle; for example, if no vehicle passes over the detector during a given time period, the occupancy would be 0 percent, whereas if a vehicle was detected passing over the detector during half of that same time period, the time occupancy would show 50 percent (Wu and Horowitz 2008). Wu et al. (2009) use the volume and occupancy data from the detectors by comparing three methods of calculating the queue length, including a Kalman filter, a conservation model, and the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) back of queue method (the HCM method proved to be ineffective, and will not be discussed in detail in this report). The original equations developed for the conservation model and Kalman filter algorithms required the volume entering and exiting the ramp to be equal, but through analysis, they found that the detectors introduced error when compared with field recorded traffic volumes. Many difficulties are introduced when relying solely on the detector data, particularly that vehicles can be double-counted or missed altogether (Wu and Gong 2009). Because of this potential for error, the original conservation model equation and Kalman filter equation were modified to balance the volumes entering and exiting the ramp, which is shown by a volume-balancing ratio (C) in each equation. Equation (4.1) is the conservation model equation with the volume-balancing ratio included, and Equation (4.2) and Equation (4.3) are the equations used for the Kalman filter method with the volume-balancing ratio. \\[\\begin{equation} Q_n = Q_{n-1} + CN_{in}  N_{out} \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] Where: \\(Q_n =\\) predicted number of on-ramp queued vehicles in the next time period (veh) \\(Q_{n-1} =\\) number of on-ramp queued vehicles in the current time period (veh) \\(C =\\) adjustment factor to account for miscounting of the detectors \\(N_{in} =\\) vehicle counts entering the on-ramp during a data collection time interval such as 20 s, which can be from queue loop detectors or entrance reporting loop detectors (veh) \\(N_{out} =\\) vehicle counts exiting the on-ramp during a data collection time interval such as 20 s, which can be from passage loop detectors (veh) \\[\\begin{equation} Q_n = Q_{n-1} + T(CV_{in}  V_{out})+K(\\hat{Q}_{n-1}  Q_{n-1}) \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] Where: \\(T =\\) time interval for number of queued vehicles calculation \\(V_{in} =\\) flow rate entering the on-ramp (veh) \\(V_{out} =\\) flow rate exiting the on-ramp (veh) \\(K = 0.22\\) recommended for one detector and \\(0.5\\) recommended for all other detector numbers, generally \\(0 &lt; K &lt; 1\\) \\(\\hat{Q}_{n-1} =\\) number of on-ramp queued vehicles calculated from detector time occupancy data (veh) \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{Q}_{n-1} = ((L_{R} * N)/(L_{E})*O_{n-1} \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] Where: \\(L_R =\\) length of the on-ramp (ft) \\(N =\\) number of lanes \\(L_E =\\) effective vehicle length (vehicle length + safety distance between vehicles), (ft) \\(O_{n-1} =\\) time occupancy collected by loop detectors Using the volume-balancing ratio \\(C\\) previously mentioned, it is presumed the conservation model and Kalman filter algorithms will produce more accurate queue length estimates. Wu et al. (2009) explain that the volume-balancing ratio may be set as a constant value or may be calculated in real time. Prior to incorporating this volume-balancing ratio, when Wu et al. (2009) utilized Equation (4.2) to find the queue length estimate based on the occupancy data, they found the correlation (\\(R\\) value) between the estimated queue length and the time occupancy to be only 0.63. This research also concluded that the relationship between volume data from the detector and the estimated number of vehicles is nonlinear, as the results gave a correlation coefficient of merely 0.18 between the two variables. Therefore, it is likely there are other factors outside the capability of this equation that affect the queue length such as detector error, driver distraction, poor weather, and traffic incidents. However, in analyzing 20 data sets from ramp meters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Wu et al. (2009) found that the volume-balancing ratio improved both the Kalman filter and the conservation models considerably in nearly all cases, and in only a select few cases were slightly more errors introduced. These errors were found to occur in the Kalman filter models because when the volume-balancing ratio is close to 1 (the detector volume entering and exiting the ramp are nearly equal), the Kalman filter coefficient \\(K\\) is also close to zero, but the equation still adds queue length to the estimate from the coefficient \\(K\\), which would introduce additional error. In contrast, when the volume-balancing ratio is not close to 1, the Kalman filter equation yield more reliable results than the conservation model. Overall, both the Kalman filter and conservation model, especially when using the volume-balancing ratio, provide generally accurate estimates of the actual queue length. References "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Site Description 5.2 Data Collection 5.3 Data Analysis", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Site Description The Layton Parkway northbound on-ramp to I-15 has two lanes entering the on-ramp from the west (two lanes turning left onto the ramp) and one lane entering the ramp from the east (one right turn lane). The left turn lanes are controlled by a left-turn only phase at the traffic signal; there is no permitted phase for this turning movement. The right turn lane is free at the entrance to the ramp, but approximately 150 feet into the ramp, there is a yield sign, as this lane ends and must merge with the lane to its left. The ramp is about 540 feet long from the entrance to the ramp meter signal. The ramp metering rate is adaptive, as the ramp metering algorithm used by UDOT automatically modifies the rate each minute as needed, based on detector data. On the day that will presented in results here (August 17, 2020), the metering rate ranged from 450 to 1200 vph. 5.2 Data Collection Several days of data collection were conducted during the PM metering period of 4:00 - 6:30 PM in August of 2020. However, this project will present solely the data obtained and analyzed on August 17, 2020 at the northbound Layton Parkway on-ramp to I-15. The data from UDOT is collected via loop detectors at three locations along the on-ramp: near the on-ramp entrance (referred to as excessive queue in this report), in the middle of the ramp (intermediate queue), and just past the ramp meter signal (passage). These data are given in one-minute periods (e.g. 4:00:00 - 4:01:00 PM) in each lane and they include the vehicle volume, the detector occupancy, the number of lanes, and the ramp metering rate. The detector data are compared with manual traffic counts of each day, which are also recorded in one-minute periods in each lane. The manual counts include the number of vehicles entering each lane at the excessive queue detectors, the total queue size at the ramp meter signal at the end of each one-minute period, and the number of moving vehicles on the ramp at the end of the one-minute period. As an example of the manually collected counts, if from 4:00:00 to 4:01:00 PM, 5 vehicles entered the far left lane, 4 vehicles from the middle lane, and 3 vehicles entered from the right lane, each lanes count during that one minute would be recorded, and the total number of vehicles entering the ramp during that minute is 12 vehicles. In addition, at 4:01:00 PM, the total queue size at the signal for all lanes is also recorded; perhaps at 4:01:00 PM, the queue size is 7 vehicles. Assuming there was no queue previous to this period, that therefore means that 5 of the 12 vehicles were able to enter the freeway between 4:00:00 and 4:01:00 PM. During the next time period, if a total of 10 new vehicles entered the ramp and at 4:02:00 PM, the queue size was 9 vehicles; that would mean that 9 vehicles would have entered the freeway during that time: the 7 vehicles from the previous time period, plus an additional 2 vehicles that entered the ramp during this time period. 5.3 Data Analysis The data collected on August 17, 2020 were first analyzed to determine whether the detectors were accurate. Several plots of the detector data for that day are shown below. First, this plot shows a comparison between the manually counted volume and the detector recorded volume at each minute period in the far left lane (which may be described as lane 1 throughout the remainder of this report). The x-axis describes the excessive queue detector manually counted volume in Lane 1 (veh/min), whereas the y-axis describes the EQ detector data in Lane 1 (veh/min). Each data point represents a one-minute time period; the \\(R^2\\) value is shown on the plot, represented by the blue line, and is approximately \\(R^2 = 0.56\\). layton_08_17_2020 &lt;- read_excel(&quot;data/layton_08_17_2020.xlsx&quot;) # Compare Lane 1 EQ Detector and Manual Counts formula1 &lt;- y ~ x eq1 &lt;- ggplot(layton_08_17_2020,aes(Manual_EQ_1,Auto_EQ_1)) + geom_jitter() + xlab(&quot;Lane 1 EQ Manual Volume (veh/min)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Lane 1 EQ Detector Volume (veh/min)&quot;) + geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;,se=FALSE) + stat_poly_eq(formula=formula1,aes(label=paste(..eq.label..,..rr.label..,sep=&quot;~~~&quot;)),parse=TRUE) print(eq1) The following plot describes a similar comparison between the manual counts and the detector volumes, but using the data from the middle lane, referred to as Lane 2. As can be seen, the \\(R^2\\) value equals \\(0.50\\) here, slightly worse than the correlation that was shown in Lane 1. layton_08_17_2020 &lt;- read_excel(&quot;data/layton_08_17_2020.xlsx&quot;) # Compare Lane 2 EQ Detector and Manual Counts eq2 &lt;- ggplot(layton_08_17_2020,aes(Manual_EQ_2,Auto_EQ_2)) + geom_jitter() + xlab(&quot;Lane 2 EQ Manual Volume (veh/min)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Lane 2 EQ Detector Volume (veh/min)&quot;)+geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;,se=FALSE) + stat_poly_eq(formula=formula1,aes(label=paste(..eq.label..,..rr.label..,sep=&quot;~~~&quot;)),parse=TRUE) print(eq2) As mentioned throughout the literature review portion of this report, the detection is known to be prone to error. In the case of this ramp, at the time of the data collection, though there is an excessive queue detector present in the right lane (Lane 3), the detection was not yet configured. This therefore means that no volumes were being recorded at the EQ 3 detector. To counteract this issue, a general measure of accuracy of Lane 3 can still be calculated to some degree by using the intermediate queue detector in Lane 2. This requires that the assumption be made that the sum of the manually counted EQ volumes in Lanes 2 and 3 equal what would be the manually counted value at the IQ detector in Lane 2. However, this is likely a realistic assumption because the IQ detector is located soon after the gore point, which would likely prevent from significant movement of vehicles otherwise. With this assumption in mind, the sum of the EQ manually counted volumes from Lanes 2 and 3 are compared with the detector data from the IQ detector in Lane 2. As seen in this plot, the \\(R^2\\) value is the highest of the three results thus far, at \\(R^2 = 0.76\\). layton_08_17_2020 &lt;- read_excel(&quot;data/layton_08_17_2020.xlsx&quot;) # Compare IQ Detector Merged into Lane 2 and Manual Counts from EQ Lanes 2+3 iq2 &lt;- ggplot(layton_08_17_2020,aes(Manual_EQ_2.3,Auto_IQ_2)) + geom_jitter() + xlab(&quot;Lane 3 IQ Manual Volume (veh/min)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Lane 3 IQ Detector Volume (veh/min)&quot;)+geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;,se=FALSE) + stat_poly_eq(formula=formula1,aes(label=paste(..eq.label..,..rr.label..,sep=&quot;~~~&quot;)),parse=TRUE) print(iq2) As a final measure of the accuracy of the detector data, the EQ detector data was compared against the IQ detector data in the same lane, Lane 1. Following the previous assumption of the vehicles mostly remaining in this lane between the EQ and IQ detectors, the plot below gives the results. As can be seen, \\(R^2 = 0.72\\), which is also acceptable. layton_08_17_2020 &lt;- read_excel(&quot;data/layton_08_17_2020.xlsx&quot;) #Compare intermediate and excessive queue counts q1 &lt;- ggplot(layton_08_17_2020,aes(Auto_IQ_1,Auto_EQ_1)) + xlab(&quot;Lane 1 IQ Detector Volume (veh/min)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Lane 1 EQ Detector Volume (veh/min)&quot;) + geom_jitter()+geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;,se=FALSE)+ stat_poly_eq(formula=formula1,aes(label=paste(..eq.label..,..rr.label..,sep=&quot;~~~&quot;)),parse=TRUE) print(q1) Overall, these four measures of the quality of the detector data show that, while the detectors are not perfect, they provide somewhat reasonable results as a beginning point. However, upon further analysis of the data, it was discovered that the time recordings of the detector data and the manually counted data were different. In this case, the detector data is approximately 60-120 seconds behind the field collected data. This would likely account for some of the error that was seen above, when comparing the detector data to the field data. A method was developed (see below) that seeks to automatically align the two data sets. The methodology seen below allows for only a three minute buffer in either directionmoving the field data as much as three minutes earlier or three minutes later than it was originally recorded. The data used to make this adjustment is from Lane 1. Though still not perfect, the plot shown below compares the lead/lag time-adjusted field counts to the detector data, and the two data sets resemble each other well throughout the data collection period 4:00 PM to 6:30 PM. layton_08_17_2020 &lt;- read_excel(&quot;data/layton_08_17_2020.xlsx&quot;) layton_08_17_2020 %&gt;% transmute(`Start time`, Detector = Auto_EQ_1, Manual = lag(Manual_EQ_1)) %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;Legend&quot;, value = &quot;# of Vehicles&quot;, -`Start time`) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = `Start time`, y = `# of Vehicles`, color = `Legend`)) + geom_line() + ggtitle(&quot;08/17/2020 Manual vs Detector Counts Using Lead/Lag Adjustment&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20)) rmse_lag &lt;- function(auto, manual, nlags){ n &lt;- 0 manual_lag &lt;- manual if(nlags &gt; 0){ while(n &lt; nlags){ manual_lag &lt;- lag(manual_lag) n &lt;- n + 1 } } else if(nlags &lt; 0){ #if nlags is negative, use lead while(n &lt; -1 * nlags){ manual_lag &lt;- lead(manual_lag) n &lt;- n + 1 } } sqrt(mean((auto - manual_lag)^2, na.rm = TRUE)) } layton_08_17_2020 %&gt;% summarise( lead3 = rmse_lag(Auto_EQ_1, Manual_EQ_1, -3), lead2 = rmse_lag(Auto_EQ_1, Manual_EQ_1, -2), lead1 = rmse_lag(Auto_EQ_1, Manual_EQ_1, -1), none = rmse_lag(Auto_EQ_1, Manual_EQ_1, 0), lag1 = rmse_lag(Auto_EQ_1, Manual_EQ_1, 1), lag2 = rmse_lag(Auto_EQ_1, Manual_EQ_1, 2), lag3 = rmse_lag(Auto_EQ_1, Manual_EQ_1, 3) ) ## # A tibble: 1 x 7 ## lead3 lead2 lead1 none lag1 lag2 lag3 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2.97 2.73 3.45 1.54 3.28 3.13 2.79 With this methodology developed, the Conservation Model and Kalman Filter Model may now be more accurately used to predict the queue length on the ramp. The volume-balancing ratio \\(C\\) for this time period was determined to be approximately \\(1.67\\) by using a Goal Seek function on Microsoft Excel. While, as explained in the literature review, the Kalman filtering coefficient, \\(K = 0.22\\). \\(L_E\\), the effective vehicle length, was assumed to be \\(24 ft\\), per Wu et al. (2009). The approximated ramp length, which was measured using Google Earth, was found to be \\(L_R = 537 ft\\). Using this information, the field data, and the detector data, both the Conservation Model and the Kalman Filter model can be developed. The figure below shows that there remains some work to be done to further refine the balanced conservation model, but this plot does provide some telling information about how the model does somewhat reflect the field collected data. layton_08_17_2020 &lt;- read_excel(&quot;data/layton_08_17_2020.xlsx&quot;) layton_08_17_2020 %&gt;% transmute(`Start time`, Detector = Conserv_balanced, Manual = lag(`Queue size`)) %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;Legend&quot;, value = &quot;Queue Size&quot;, -`Start time`) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = `Start time`, y = `Queue Size`, color = `Legend`)) + geom_line() + ggtitle(&quot;08/17/2020 Manual vs Detector Counts Using Conservation Model&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24)) The Kalman filter model vs. the field collected data is shown in the plot below. Because the Kalman filter model is strongly based on the Conservation Model, the two plots strongly resemble one another. However, with the additional factor with the \\(K\\) coefficient, the Kalman filter model seeks to improve on the Conservation model. layton_08_17_2020 &lt;- read_excel(&quot;data/layton_08_17_2020.xlsx&quot;) layton_08_17_2020 %&gt;% transmute(`Start time`, Detector = Kalman_balanced, Manual = lag(`Queue size`)) %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;Legend&quot;, value = &quot;Queue Size&quot;, -`Start time`) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = `Start time`, y = `Queue Size`, color = `Legend`)) + geom_line() + ggtitle(&quot;08/17/2020 Manual vs Detector Counts Using Kalman Filter Model&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24)) "],["summary.html", "Chapter 6 Summary", " Chapter 6 Summary The expected wait time at an on-ramp is directly related to the queue length that occurs due to the ramp meter signal. There are few algorithms currently developed to estimate the wait time at freeway entrance ramps solely from detector data, and more research remains to be done. Most of the algorithms currently available require extensive calibration by performing manual traffic counts, which is expensive and time consuming. However, the Kalman filter and conservation model equations have proven to show reliable estimates of the actual wait time, when compared with manual counts. These equations will provide a more accurate estimate of the quality of detector data available and will be a crucial step in estimating the wait time of vehicles at this ramp. Further study is currently being conducted for this project to find a correlation between the queue length and wait time, and by finding this correlation, the expected wait time at on-ramps will be more precisely predicted.
