# Abstract

Located on many on-ramps throughout Davis, Salt Lake, and Utah counties, **ramp meters** are used to regulate the flow of traffic during peak hours. On each ramp, there are **detectors** beneath the pavement located in three areas, including passage (after the ramp meter signal), intermediate (middle of the on-ramp), and excessive queue detectors (near the on-ramp entrance). These detectors provide data that include volume and **occupancy** counts, **ramp meter rate**, and the number of lanes on the ramp. UDOT is continuously collecting these data points to analyze ramp and freeway operations. Using these data, this project will seek to develop a reliable algorithm that can accurately reflect ramp meter wait time, which will be published to a website by UDOT, where it will be viewable by the public. The focus of this project will be on the metered on-ramp at Layton Parkway in Davis County, with the aim for the algorithm to then be applied to additional ramps in Utah in the future.
